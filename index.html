We believe that analyzing this data visually can help promote public good, as it allows people to understand our countryâ€™s crime history as well as choose safe places to travel and live. We hope to bring awareness to and spark conversations about crime patterns in our country and how that affects people.*Please note that our data source did not provide any data for the state of New York from 1960-1964, so those years are not depicted in our visualizations.*

            <div class="card-body">Most people assume that states like California, New York, Illinois, etc. would have the most crime, largely due to the big number of metropolitan areas in these states. While our data concerning crime totals does generally reflect this idea, in comparing the crime rates over time, it appears that these states do not stick out, and not really any do for that matter. The rates accurately depict national crime trends per year, indicating that crime has increased from the 60s throughout the 90s, and has recently decreased into the 21st century. Thus, in recent years as increasing efforts have been made to reduce crime, from our data it is clear that these trends reflect across all states, not just those with high crime numbers overall.

      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>In general, property crime rates started out low in all states in the 1960s, then significantly increased from the 70s-90s, and have gone back down leading into the 21st century. The southwest region and Florida consistently show higher property crime rates than the rest of the country, especially during the 70s-90s period.</p>
      
      

      <!-- property totals -->

      <h1>Property Crime Totals</h1>

      <iframe src="property_crimes_totals.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe>
      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>The map of property crime totals reflects the general increase and decrease in crime that we see in the property crime rates, however highlights that California, Texas, Florida, and New York have consistently higher property crime numbers than the rest of the nation.</p>

      <iframe src="violent_crimes_rates.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe>
      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>Like property crime rates, violent crime rates also increased throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and decreased into the 21st century. However, violent crime rates appear to be much lower across the nation than property crimes, with no states possessing noticeably higher rates than the others.</p>

      <iframe src="violent_crimes_totals.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe>
      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>Violent crime numbers appear consistently low throughout the nation over the years, however California, Texas, Illinois, Florida, and New York especially stand out, most likely attributed to their higher populations.</p>

      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>Over time, crime rates have also increased in the 60s-90s and then decreased again in recent years. No states appear to stick out over others in terms of total crime rate, however the middle and south of the United States appear generally darker than the most northern states.</p>

      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <p>Similar to the other totals, California, New York, Texas, and Florida appear to have the most crime by sheer numbers, though this is likely attributed to population.</p>
